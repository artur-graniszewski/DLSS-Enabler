TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------
You can use the following commandline arguments to troubleshoot your game:

 --dlss-debug           - shows the debug console in the background
 --dlss-debug=extra     - shows extensive debug information in a debug console
 --dlss-logging=on/off  - enables logging to the file (default: off)
 --dlss-version         - reports the DLL version used to enable DLSS Frame Generation
 --dlss-upscaler=auto/fsr/xess/dlss - allows to select default DLSS upscaler implementation/emulation, (default: auto = XeSS for non RTX cards/DLSS for RTX cards)
 --dlss-upscaler-quality=sys/ultra - ultra setting forces XeSS/FSR upscalers to render in native resolution only (default: sys - use generic quality profiles) 
 --dlss-hags=on/off/sys - enables/disables or uses system setting for Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling even on unsupported hardware/drivers (default: on)
 --dlss-help            - shows the help message with all the arguments supported by the DLL
 --dlss-arch=ZZZ        - allows to spoof different NVIDIA GPU architecture, possible choices: ada (default, if argument not present), turing, ampere, ie --dlss-arch=ampere
 --dlss-disable         - disables the DLL functionality
 --dlss-skip-validation - skips system checks (that are validating HAGS, NVIDIA signature checking or presence of FSR3 files)
 --dlss-diagnostics     - Shows the mod diagnostics
 --dlss-nvapi=mock/proxy/sys - Controls which Nvidia API interface to use (default: proxy).
 --dlss-reflex-fps=ZZZ  - Enables frame rate limiter (default: no limit), where ZZZ is a number of target frames per second (including generated ones)
 --dlss-gpu-name="ZZZ"  - Overrides the name of the GPU reported to the application (default: none = use original GPU name), available only when AMD/Intel compatibility package is installed.
 --dlss-gpu-vram=32g    - Overrides the amount of GPU RAM reported to the application (available only after installing AMD/INTEL support package), can be set to any value between 1 and 128 gigabytes
for additional info).



EXAMPLES:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) Check if DLLS enabler is installed successfully (shows a pop-up with its version and closes the game on start):
    
   "C:\Games\The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt GOTY\bin\x64_dx12\dlss-enabler.exe" witcher3.exe --dlss-debug=extra

2) Run Witcher 3 with debug console enabled:

   "C:\Games\The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt GOTY\bin\x64_dx12\dlss-enabler.exe" witcher3.exe --dlss-debug=extra

3) Run Cyberpunk 2077 with Cyber Engine Tweaks present in its x64 directory:

   "C:\Games\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\dlss-enabler.exe" cyberpunk2077.exe

4) Run Witcher 3 with DLLS enabler spoofing ampere GPU:

   "C:\Games\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\dlss-enabler.exe" cyberpunk2077.exe --dlss-arch=ampere


KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) Problem: Vignette shaking when quickly moving the camera up/down or left/right in Cyberpunk
   Solution: Install two mods disabling vignette when crouching and during the normal movement. If necessary enable vignette feature provided by NVIDIA overlay (filter options under Alt+F3 shortcut)

2) Problem: Ghosting of moving objects
   Solution: Ghosting needs to be expected from FSR3 Frame Generation feature. You can reduce its visibility by increasing the host FPS, in order to do so, enable image upscaling, or if its enabled - reduce its quality and/or reduce the graphics settings in general. Please note that upscalers introduce their own ghosting (XeSS technique in particular), so choose wisely and experiment.

3) Problem: Frame generation blocks the in-game V-Sync option and sets it to off
   Solution: Open NVIDIA control panel, and force V-Sync option there, pick either "adaptive" or "fast" option to reduce the V-Sync latency

4) Problem: Camera lag noticeable when moving or looking around
   Solution: Latency can be reduced by increasing the number of host frames generated by your GPU, see solution to a "Ghosting of moving objects".

5) Problem: I enabled DLSS in the game options and I see the black screen instead of the actual game.
   Solution: DLSS Enabler and the DLSSG to FSR3 mod do not implement the DLSS upscaler, they just enable the Frame Generation capability. Please choose a different upscaling method instead (FSR2 or XeSS).

6) Problem: After playing the game for few minutes Frame Generation feature disables itself for no reason/Frame Generation option is on, but the game is unstable
   Solution: Update your game to the latest version and try again, if issue persist, try to troubleshoot it with --dlss-debug command or report the issue on Discord channel

7) Problem: I want to use Steam/Good Old Games/Epic Megastore client to run the game
   Solution: Try to install the preferred solution (based on DLL file) first and check if it works. Universal solution should be used only if the preferred one is not working as it's less compatible with external game launchers, though more compatible with the games started directly.

8) Problem: There version of nukem9 mod bundled with this installer is outdated, how to install the latest one?
   Solution: Download the ZIP package with the latest version of nukem9 mod and copy paste the DLL files into the game directory where the game executable is. DLLS enabler will detect these files and use them instead of the bundled version.

9) Problem: I want to install the DLL version of the mod, but there's already a file called "version.dll" in my game directory that is not part of this package. What to do?
   Solution: You can either rename it to version-original.dll before installing the mod, or if this fails (the game doesn't start after installation, or reports any other error), you can try to se the universal solution, or uninstall the mod that delivered the original version.dll file.

10) Problem: My game behaves weird/doesn't start/Frame Generation setting cannot be enabled
    Solution: Make sure you didn't install any other mods that try to enable Frame Generation feature (like LukeFZ mod or dummy nvapi64.dll file). If so, revert these changes before installing DLSS enabler. Additionally, make sure your game is up to date (you are running the latest version of the game), as the old versions tend to not to be able to detect Frame Generation capability or be unstable with Frame Generation on.

11) Problem: Original nukem9 mod requires me to disable NVIDIA Driver Signature Checks, is it also true in case of this installation?
    Solution: No, in case of this installation Frame Generation mechanism will work even with Signature Checks on. Please DO NOT disable them unless its really required as part of troubleshooting process.

12) Problem: I want to troubleshoot some issue with this mod, how to do this?
    Solution: After starting the game hit a combination of Ctrl+` (Control + Tilde) twice to spawn a debug console. You can close it and spawn it again afterwards by hitting the same keys again.

13) Problem: DLLS Enabler reports that Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS) is not supported by Windows Driver
    Solution: Update your GPU drivers to the latest version, or if you're using an older AMD GPU, consider installing custom/community drivers with Hardware Accetelared GPU Scheduling enabled. If your GPU driver doesn't support HAGS at all, start the game with --dlss-hags=on and --dlss-skip-validation commandline arguments to simulate HAGS functionality in DLSS Enabler.

14) Problem: I'm an AMD/Intel GPU owner and after installing NVIDIA Runtime Environment package Ray Tracing no longer works in my game
    Solution: For now, DLSS Enabler is in conflict with RT capabilities, to restore RT capability, you need to uninstall the DLSS Enabler mod and forget about Frame Generation feature.

  - Feature: Extended debugging capabilities (--dlss-debug=extra switch)

2.90.400
  - Feature: DLSS Enabler enables Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS) by default (even on unsupported hardware). You can modify this behaviour by running your game with –dlss-hags=on/off/sys argument (where “sys” value tells the DLSS Enabler to honour the system wide HAGS setting).
  - Feature: --dlss-skip-validation no longer raises a warning if Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling is switched off/unsupported by the system, as long as –dlss-hags argument is not equal “sys” or “off”.
  - Feature: Due to NVIDIA license restrictions, after installing the optional AMD/Intel/GTX 8xx/9xx support module, installer will warn the user that additional, manual step is necessary (_nvngx.dll file needs to be provided by the end user on his/her own, by extracting it from NVIDIA drivers package and saving into the game directory).
  - Bugfix: Installer no longer shows the diagnostics window after the installation finishes (as due to the race condition, it often reported incorrect data). You can run the diagnostics process by running the game with –dlss-diagnostics argument.

2.90.300
  - Feature: Implemented functionality to enable Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS) on GPUs that officially don't support that feature (AMD RDNA2, INTEL ARC, GTX 8xx/9xx cards). Use --dlss-hags=on switch together with --dlss-skip-validation to enable HAGS in game.
  - Feature: Added optional debug ini file to control the debug feature in Nukem9 DLSSG to FSR3 mod (file is deployed to game directory under the dlssg_to_fsr3.ini name)
  - Feature: More informative error message explaining the need to run dlss-enabler.exe with elevated rights if the game it needs to run requires them too
  - Feature: Updated error message telling what to do in cases when Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling is not supported by actual hardware
  - Bugfix: Validator looked for NVIDIA runtime files in the wrong directory during the installation process on AMD/INTEL cards.

2.90.000
  - Feature: Updated DLSSG to FSR3 mod from version 0.81 to 0.90

2.81.200
  - Feature: Added experimental DLSSG support for AMD RDNA3 cards (do not install it if you don't need it!)
  - Feature: Implemented system diagnostic module, run the game with --dlss-diagnostics parameter to see the report (in DLL mode) or call dlss-enabler.exe with /g flag (in Executable mode).
  - Bugfix: Modified versioning pattern, now its a sum of DLLs enabler version (2.00.00) and bundled Nukem9 module (0.81) which results in version 2.81.x00

1.4.81
  - Bugfix/Feature: DLSS enabler DLL is now protected against possible unload from memory of the game
  - Bugfix: DLSS enabler DLL is now looking for the DLSSG files inside of the directory where the game executable is instead of current working directory (cwd). This is helpful for troubleshooting.
  - Feature: Considerable code refactoring
  - Feature: Updated DLLSG to FSR3 package to version 0.81

1.3.80
  - Feature: Installation package installs DLSS Enabler and Nukem9 DLSSG to FSR3 mod alltogether.
  - Feature: Nukem9 DLSSG to FSR3 mod installed by the installer no longer needs to have the NVIDIA Driver Signature Checks disabled
  - Feature: DLSS enabler DLL is able to detect if a custom version of the Nukem9 DLSSG to FSR3 mod is present in the game directory and loads it instead of the bundled one
  - Feature: DLSS enabler DLL comes equipped with an on-demand Debug Console that can be displayed after the game starts (just hit ctrl+` >twice< to show the console, and ctrl+` again to hide it or show it again)
  - Feature: DLSS enabler DLL is reading the DLSSG to FSR3 logs and presents them in Debug Console if its enabled.
  - Bugfix: No sudden RTD when starting the game with --dlss-off flag
  - Bugfix: Removed duplicate of version.dll file from the installation binary 
  - Bugfix/Feature: DLSS enabler DLL is now equipped with naive detection that protects itself from attaching to a crash reporting processes that are spawned by the game executable.

  - Bugfix: DLSS enabler DLL validation checked the wrong value type (BINARY instead of DWORD) responsible for NVIDIA signature checks
  - Feature: DLSS enabler DLL validation now suggests --dlss-skip-validation argument in case of validation failure

1.1.1
  - Bugfix: DLSS enabled DLL will now assume that HAGS is enabled by default if the appropriate registry key is missing, in such case --dlss-version message will report HAGS status as "enabled (inferred)" rather than just "enabled"
